    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Education</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I received my BS and MS degrees in Biomedical Engineering from The University of Tennessee, Knoxville.</li>
      <li>My undergraduate research experiences included additive manufacturing at Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Manufacturing Demonstration Facility (MDF) as well as medical device design/development.</li>
      <li>In graduate school, I investigated composite bearing surfaces for total hip arthroplasty.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Experience</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Throughout undergrad and grad school, I assistant taught an honors physics course for freshmen engineering students.</li>
      <li>Since graduation, my professional experience includes an operations role at a fast-paced SaaS start-up and, currently, as an engineering consultant for an intellectual property law firm.</li>
      <li>In my current role, I draft legally robust and technically sound patent applications for clients across a broad range of innovations, including computer hardware and software. I provide strategic consultation throughout all stages of patent prosecution and after issuance, e.g. to investigate potential patent infringement.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Etc.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>My curiosity and passion for thoughtful design are insatiable.
      <li>Curiosity and desire to continuously learn new skills led me to Epicodus, where I am currently enrolled in an introductory programming course.
      <li>I enjoy running trails in Forest Park, reading, biking, hiking, and discovering new-to-me music.</li>
    </ul>
